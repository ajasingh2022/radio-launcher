# Radio Launcher

> radio-launcher - radio-station client.

### Why ?
I decided that I wanted to be a radio host, but I had no particular desire to understand the existing software and I created my own software, maybe someday it will become a standard, I tried to achieve a better result.

### Get started

Clone the github repository and install nodejs.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/prohetamine/radio-launcher.git
$ cd radio-launcher
$ npm install -g yarn
$ yarn
```

### Examples and description

To launch the launcher, use the command.

```sh
$ yarn start
```

The launcher is firmly connected with [radio-station](https://github.com/prohetamine/radio-station) and cannot work without it, log in using the data provided by the [radio-station](https://github.com/prohetamine/radio-station).

This is the main and only menu, but so far there are no tracks and the broadcast will not begin.

We are on the air, dragging tracks from the "Tracks" and "Favorites" sections to the air forming a queue order.
