# radio-launcher

> radio-launcher - radio-station client.

### Why ?
I decided that I wanted to be a radio host, but I had no particular desire to understand the existing software and I created my own software, maybe someday it will become a standard, I tried to achieve a better result.

### Get started

Clone the github repository and install nodejs

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:prohetamine/radio-launcher.git
$ cd radio-launcher
$ npm install -g yarn
$ yarn
```

### Examples and description

To launch the launcher, use the command

```sh
$ yarn start
```

The launcher is firmly connected with radio-station and cannot work without it, log in using the data provided by the radio-station
